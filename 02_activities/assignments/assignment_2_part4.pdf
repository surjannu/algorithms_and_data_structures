    "While working on Assignment 1, my main focus was understanding the problem requirements clearly before jumping into coding. Breaking each problem into smaller parts—such as identifying inputs, expected outputs, and constraints—helped me choose appropriate data structures and write cleaner solutions. For the “first duplicate” problem, recognizing that the order of appearance mattered guided me toward using a set, which provided an efficient and simple approach. Writing explanations for why the solution works and analyzing time and space complexity helped reinforce my understanding of algorithm efficiency beyond just getting correct output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the review process of my partner assignment-1, I gained valuable insight into how different people approach the same problem. Reviewing my partner’s solution helped me think more critically about code structure, edge cases, and clarity of explanations. It also highlighted the importance of documenting assumptions, such as input validity and in-place modifications. Explaining my own solution aloud made me more aware of gaps in my reasoning and encouraged me to justify design choices more clearly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this assignment improved both my problem-solving skills and my ability to communicate technical ideas effectively. The peer review experience was especially helpful in developing a deeper, more confident understanding of the concepts."
